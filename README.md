Distribution of Lantana camara, Senna siamea and Senna spectabilis in the Mubuku Valley, Uganda

Frequency of <i>Lantana camara</i>, <i>Senna siamea</i>, and <i>S. spectabilis</i> in each 500-m section along a 23 km transect in the Mubuku Valley, Uganda. Species occurrence was recorded every 10 metres (50 observations per section). The occurrence of the three target species was recorded every 10 metres, within a 100-metre width on both sides of the transect. The transect was divided into 47 sections of 500 metres, and species frequency was calculated as the proportion of 10-metre segments (50 per section) with occurrences in each section. A shapefile with frequency data by section is provided.
