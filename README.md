# mubuku

Frequency of <i>Lantana camara</i>, <i>Senna siamea</i>, and <i>S. spectabilis</i> in each 500-m section along a 23 km transect in the Mubuku Valley, Uganda. Species occurrence was recorded every 10 metres (50 observations per section). The occurrence of the three target species was recorded in January 2018 every 10 metres, within a 100-metre width on both sides of the transect. The transect was divided into 47 sections of 500 metres, and species frequency was calculated as the proportion of 10-metre segments (50 per section) with occurrences in each section. A shapefile with frequency data by section is provided.

A shapefile with per-section frequency data is available in the [`shapefiles/`](shapefiles/) folder.

The following table provides a description of the field names used in the shapefile.
